# Auto Crop NDC
Compute NDC Bounding Box for USD Prims in Houdini<br><br>

This Houdini Python script calculates the combined bounding box of selected USD prims in Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC) based on a specified camera. It supports an optional padding value and writes the result to a dataWindowNDC primvar on `/Render/rendersettings`. Useful for render region optimization or viewport framing based on object visibility.
