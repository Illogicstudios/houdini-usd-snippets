# Simple Caustics
A tool to simulate basic caustics directly in Houdini solaris with karma.<br><br>

Caustics limitations:
- Not fully physically based â€” intensity and color are approximated and artistically controlled.
- Multiple refraction events are not handled accurately (e.g., liquid inside a glass).
- Requires caching and manual setup.
- Does not scale well in large scenes (similar limitations to photon-based caustics).
